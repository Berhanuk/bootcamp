# Movies Database (movies_db)

A sample database includes three tables: `actors`, `directors` and `movies`. The data is available as .csv files under directory `movies-data`

## Installation [with docker container]:

1. Start Docker container with port mapping `-p 3306:3306`:

  - MAC/Linux/Docker ToolBox
  ```
  docker run -it \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  nycdsa/mysql-movies-db
  ```
  
  - Windows
  ```
  docker run -it ^
  -p 3306:3306 ^
  nycdsa/mysql-movies-db
  ```
  
  Note: if you have MySQL service running locally, the port 3306 might be occupied already and you should change the port mapping with `-p 3307:3306`.
  
  
## Installation with Docker Toolbox:

If you're using Docker Toolbox, you might have issue downloading with `git clone` inside the docker container. Then you should:

1. `git clone` the repo to your computer first and then `cd` into the `bootcamp`  directory.

2. Start docker container with mount option:
  
  - MAC OS
  
  ```
  docker run -it \
  -p 3306:3306 \
  -v "$(pwd)":/home/ubuntu/bootcamp \
  nycdsa/mysql-movies-db
  ```
  
  - Windows

  ```
  docker run -it ^
  -p 3306:3306 ^
  -v %cd%:/home/ubuntu/bootcamp ^
  nycdsa/mysql-movies-db
  ```
  
3. When the container is up, follow *step 3* and *step 4* from previous section to complete the database setup.

  - Connection Name: [anything]
  - Hostname: 127.0.0.1 [or docker-machine ip if using Docker Toolbox]
  - Port: 3306 [or 3307 if mapping was set to 3307]
